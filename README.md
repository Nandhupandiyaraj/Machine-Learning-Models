Machine Learning Models

Overview

This project explores various machine learning models for predictive analytics and data-driven decision-making. It covers both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization. Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and TensorFlow are used for efficient implementation.

Features

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Supervised Learning: Regression and classification models for prediction tasks.

Unsupervised Learning: Clustering techniques for pattern recognition.

Model Evaluation: Performance metrics and cross-validation.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

Deployment: Building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline.
